<h3>Rails: A Framework for Ruby</h3>
<h4>{Ruby => Rails; Python => Django}</h4>

<p>So, as the little note above suggests, in a former life I was a linguist. As such, I would have seen the phrase "Ruby on Rails" and thought "cool, a colocation" (a colocation is a group words that often occur together), then moved on to some other topic. Academics can be easily distracted...</p>
<p>Right, back to Rails. So I would hear this phrase. As I started teaching myself Python, I learned about Frameworks, and how they can be used to both simplify and extend the functionality of a programming language. Ruby is a great language, and it can do lots of fun things, but it seems like most of the Ruby jobs mention website development using the Rails framework.</p>
<p>We all know Ruby's creation story: Matz wanted an object-oriented scripting language, and didn't like anything out there at the time, so he created Ruby. Cool. Thanks, Matz!</p>
<p>Rails was originally developed as part of the Basecamp (formerly 37 Signals) project management application, and it was later abstracted out and published on its own as a framework for web development for Ruby.</p>
<p>Rails' core philosophy is "Convention over Configuration," meaning that you don't need to actively specify standard items, they would have default settings which would be applied unless the developer consciously chooses to override them.</p>
<p>Rails uses the model-view-controller (MVC) configuration. A model is mapped to a (default) database. The controller responds to requests from surver-side applications and offers views in HTML. Rails philosophy here is "Fat models, skinny controllers," meaning that most of the logic should be baked into the model, not the controller. </p><img src="http://media.djangopony.com/img/magic-pony-django-wallpaper.png" align="right" height = 160px, width = 200px>
<p>Rails also plays nicely with JavaScript, using several JS libraries and JQuery.</p>
<p>Lastly, Rails is only one of many frameworks for Ruby. Others include Sinatra, Padrino and Lotus.</p>
<p>That said, the Django Pony is way cooler than the Rails logo.</p>
