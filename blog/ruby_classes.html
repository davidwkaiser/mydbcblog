<h3>Classes and "Jigs"</h3>
<h4>Lessons on Object-Oriented Programming from an Apprentice Carpenter</h4>
<h4>February 27, 2016</h4>
<section>
<p>During graduate school, I often worked as a carpenter during the summer. Carpenters spend a lot of time measuring, marking, and cutting wood so that it fits just right into the structure or space.</p>

<p>Sometimes we needed to make many pieces of a certain shape and size. In those cases, rather than measure, mark and cut each piece of wood separately, a very time consuming process, we would build a "jig."  This jig could be attached to the wood we were cutting, and it would guide our blades so that we could cut faster, and cut each piece identically, a double benefit. Now, if we were only making a small number of a certain piece, the time and attention required to make the jig didn't make sense. But if we knew we had to make a lot pieces, or wanted the option of making more later, then a little bit of time up front would save us a lot of trouble later.</p>

<p>What does any of this have to do with Ruby, or with programing? Classes in Ruby are a lot like a carpenter's jig. It helps you to create lots of similar items quickly while maintaining similarities across objects.</p>

<p>For example, if you were a freelancer and wanted to track information about yourself and your work, you probably wouldn't create an "employee" class, you would just store the information somewhere in your program, and this would be fine for as long as it lasted. But if you started hiring people and storing their data in the same way, you might find that your data is chaotic and accessing or changing it is inefficient.</p>

<p>That is the point where a carpenter would recognize that he or she is going to need a jig, and where the programmer is going to need a class. He or she would spend a little time creating it, but then the ease of creating new, standardized items, ready for use, would make that a good investment of time and energy.</p>
