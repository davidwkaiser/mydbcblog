    <h3>Reflections on Git</h3>
    <h3>A Fantastic Tool</h3>
    <h4>January 21, 2016</h4>

    <section>
      <p>
        What are the benefits of version control? It allows us to see different versions of a program, and if documentation is good, we will know why we made a particular change, and if there are bugs, we can go back to an earlier version. If there are multiple developers, it becomes possible for them to work on one code file at the same time, thus increasing productivity and speed. Also, if there are multiple developers, using Git (together with GitHub) allows other developers to review code before it is added to the code base, reducing the likelihood that one developer's work creates problems for other developers, they can address the problem before it becomes part of the code base.
      </p>
      <p>
          Git helps us to track changes in several ways. First, we create a new "branch," so that we make changes to that, not directly to the master. Why do this? Because if we make changes directly to the master, we might break something, and fear of doing that would discourage experimentation and innovation. Also, creating branches allows multiple programmers to work on a project at once, and Git can track them all, and allow other developers to review and approve changes in advance, thus improving compatibility within the code. We never have to cut and past code into the master. Git also allows us to maintain changes in several states. When we create a new branch, we can make some changes, when we are happy with them, we can stage the files with "add," (and not stage others that are still being worked on), then "commit" them, thus fixing them into the branch. When ready, we can review and merge into the master. At any point in the program, we can use "status" to review which files are in progress and which are staged.
      </p>
      <p>
          GitHub is useful for several reasons. First, because it is web-based, it is a back-up so that files are not lost if the computer is. Second, it is great for sharing files. Developers working remotely from each other can share and work on the same files.Lastly, GitHub allows us to review files side by side (during a "pull request") before merging them into the code base.
      </p>
      <p>
          For me, learning Git has been terrifying, because the underlying concept of maintaining control over versions depends on a personal weakness around tracking the logistics of various objects, and it took a while to figure out conceptually how Git works. As I get comfortable with it, I will probably love it because it does the work that I dislike / fear. For the moment I worry about setting up directories in the wrong place, overwriting things, breaking things, etc. As I follow the instructions, even when I don't completely understand, I find it gets easier by doing. I look forward to being comfortable with Git and GitHub. I have already made a great deal of progress, and I expect that to continue.
