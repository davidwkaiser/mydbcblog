<h3>Reflections on Web Design and Construction</h3>
<h4>The Good and The Bad</h4>
<h4>March 20, 2016</h4>
<section>
<p>This will be short. It is basically a bit of feedback to myself on my skills around HTML, CSS and web design.</p>
<p>The Good:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can create a basic site. </li>
<li>It works and I can maintain it properly.</li>
<li>I have written some good content.</li>
<li>When I know what to do, I am can execute it in HTML and CSS</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>I dislike visual design to the point of resisting it. I have a certain sense of style (I do dress very well), but I find that 1> I am not yet familiar with what distinguishes a nice web page from a crappy web page, visually, and 2> unlike clothing, which is largely toggling between options (I'm going to wear a shirt, it's just a matter of style and color), visual design of a website sems to be much more "blank slate," and I find it intimidating. </li>
<li>As a result, HTML and CSS is not as good as it could be, because I haven't practiced as much.</li>
<li>My site looks like it was built in 2002.</li>
<li>This is a problem, but one which can be surmounted.</li>
</ul>
<p>To-Do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find people who can help me get comfortable with visual design. OR </li>
<li>Find someone who likes to design, and execute his / her vision.</li>
<li>Find practice exercises where I am creating based on specifications so I can practice HTML / CSS</li>
<li>Lighten up, make some ugly sites, then take what I have learned an use it to redesign this old 2002 site.</li>
<li>I remember from my Django course that things lilke headers and footers can be abstracted out into their own files, to ease maintenance, but I forget how to do it. I will find it and insert into these pages. THe cut and paste template is very inefficient.</li>
</ul>
