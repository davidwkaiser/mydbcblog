How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was scary at first, since I wasn't as prepared as I'd like to be, but I settled down pretty quickly into the role of navigator.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I did. I have done a lot of website creation, but mostly working off of WordPress templates, where I'm adapting somethign which exists, not creating from scratch, so this was a useful exercise.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Clarity, simplicity.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
We used several headings, mostly to make it look like we wanted it to look, but also because these headings marked the semantic roles of the information within the post. As I get more comfortable with CSS, I can see how it would be useful for CSS to handle the visual presentation, and let HTML handle the semantic side of things.
