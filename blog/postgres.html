<h3>Postgres and Migrations</h3>
<h4>Order Matters</h4>
<h4>June 10, 2016</h4>
<section>
<p>This is my first post to this blog in a long time. I created this blog as part of the "Phase 0" prep work for <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>, and I have since completed the whole program! Anyway, I know the whoel blog needs an overhaul, but in the meantime I decided to post a little bit that I learned in the course of a side project.</p>
<p>So, I created a toy project during DBC, a Rails app with a SQLite3 database, and I wanted to deploy it on Heroku. Heroku requires Postgres instead of SQLite. So, I broke my app trying to install Postgres, then rebuilt it from the parts of the old one.</p>
<p>When I first ran the migrations to create the new DB, it crashed. What? Why? It worked for SQLite? I couldn't find much on Google about why, but I had a hunch. My Rails app had nested resources with a "has_many ~ belongs_to" association, and I ran the inner, "dependent" one first, and it threw an error and crashed. I reversed the order and ran the outer migration first (the one that "has_many," not the one that "belongs_to"), and it ran just fine.</p>
<p>So that's it, it's not a game changer, but this is my contribution towards the comunity, hopefully if your migrations crash and you can't figure out why, this post will help.</p>
