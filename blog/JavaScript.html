<h3>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h3>
<h4>Six of one...?</h4>
<h4>March 4, 2016</h4>
<section>
<p>Way back when, I started with Python and learned about 'dictionaries' (actually, *really* way back when, it was BASIC, but that's a story for another day)...</p>
<p>For Dev Bootcamp, I switched to Ruby. In Ruby, a Python 'dictionary' is called a 'hash,' both even use the same terms 'key' and 'value.' Fine. I've studied foreign languages, I know that languages mostly do the same stuff, they just encode it differently (Do NOT get me started on some of the wacky grammatical categories that adorn Polish). Of course, Ruby has 'objects' and 'classes,' too. All good so far, this is kinda fun.</p>

<p>Then we switch to JavaScript....</p>

<p>JavaScript has arrays, just like Ruby and Python. Great. Then I read about 'objects' in JavaScript. At first, I think to myself that this is poorly named, seeing as it's basically a 'hash' or 'dictionary,' except they call it an 'object,' which evokes the phrase Object-Oriented Programming,' but this is just a dumb old hash, a data structure, not an "object." This confusion lasted a few days...</p>
<p>It turns out that a JS 'object' is the platypus of the software world, it's part data structure like a Ruby 'hash,'' it's also part 'instance' and part 'class.'</p>
<p>A JS 'object' can have functions inside it, so in that respect it's different from a 'hash,' but similar to a Ruby 'instance.' Toss in constructor functions and prototypes (see <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-basics-of-object-oriented-javascript--net-7670">HERE</a> and <a href="https://blog.pivotal.io/labs/labs/javascript-constructors-prototypes-and-the-new-keyword">HERE</a> for descriptions), and JS has some nice OOP features.</p>
<p>You can instantiate new items, you can create inheritance, and it has instance and class methods. All pretty cool. </p>
<p> But like our friend the platypus, it still looks weird if you're accustomed to the elegance of Ruby.</p>
