*What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?*
*What did you learn about CSS positioning?*

I didn't use these much in this exercise, I already had the positioning I wanted based on my wireframe. I learned more about these from pairing session 3.4, moving the various boxes around, changing their shapes and order, etc.

*What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?*
Easiest is once I figure out what to do, just doing it. If I don't know, I google it, figure out the code I need, and drop it in, then tweak it until it works. It just doesn't feel that hard. The hardest is is doing the creative design work. I don't have an eye for this *yet*. Instructions like "add some CSS!" are hard, it's too broad for me to handle at this time. It's like saying "write a creative story." Ugh, where do I start. But if you say "write a creative story about a duck and a penny, that would be easier since there is less mental space in my brain to search. Anyway, bottom line is design scares me. I have a good eye for style (I like to think I dress well), so as I get confident, this will get better, but right now I'm freaked out. I may need to manage this by creating my own constraints and guidelines. I can also look at other websites, both from a visual perspective, as well as "under the hood" to see how they manage the look.

*What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?*
I learned that it will get easier. it's just a matter of tinkering. If 40px is too much, try 30 or 25 until it looks right.
